<H1>Java ChatRoom Applet Demo</H1>
<P>This is a <EM>very</EM> simple Chat Room applet.
Note that if you try to load it from your <EM>local</EM> machine
as opposed to a server, you won't have much luck, since Java Applets
are only allowed - for very good security reasons - to open a network
connection back to where they came from!  Load it from the server instead.
<HR>
<APPLET code="ChatRoom" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=100>
	<param name="port" value="9999">
	<P>This will only work with a Java 1.1 (or later) browser.<P>
</APPLET>
<P>The Chat Room should appear in its own window. If it does not,
check to make sure that you have a JDK1.1-enabled Web Browser
(Netscape 4.1.5 or later, MSIE 4.x or later, or JDK1.1 AppletViewer).
Check to make sure that the Chat Window is not hidden behind another
window, too (on systems with an IconPanel or a TaskBar, look there!).
<HR>
<P>Use <A HREF="ChatRoom.java">The Source</A>, Luke.
Alternately, see <A HREF="ChatServer.java">the server source</A>.
