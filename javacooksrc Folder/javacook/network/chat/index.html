<H1>Java ChatRoom Applet Demo</H1>
<P>This is a <EM>very</EM> simple Chat Room applet.
<P><A HREF="http://server/chat/chat.html">Load the Applet from the server</A>.
<P>Note that if you try to load it from your <EM>local</EM> machine
as opposed to a server, you won't have much luck, since Java Applets
are only allowed - for very good security reasons - to open a network
connection back to where they came from!
So, the applet will start, but you will NOT be able to login.
Load it from the server instead.

<P>Or, you can Use <A HREF="ChatRoom.java">The Source</A>, Luke.
See also <A HREF="ChatServer.java">the server source</A>.
