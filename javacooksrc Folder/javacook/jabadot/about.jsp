<H1>About JabaDot</H1>
<P>JabaDot is the world's first all-open-source, pure Java,
news portal site.
<P>JabaDot is the product of the imagination (or lack thereof)
of Ian Darwin, author of the O'Reilly
<a href="http://javacook.darwinsys.com/">Java Cookbook</a>.
<P>Grateful acknowledgement is made to 
<a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">SlashDot</a>,
the original open-source news portal site.
<h2>Downloading...</h2>
<p>Check out our open-source <a href="LEGAL_NOTICE.txt">
source code license</a> for 
when the code becomes avaible for
<a href="download.jsp">downloading the source</a>.
<h2>What's in a name...</h2>
<p>I was going to call it "JavaDot", but Sun's 
trademark policy precluded that and, being
freeware, I have no funding for lawyers to fight it.

<p>Thanks for calling!
