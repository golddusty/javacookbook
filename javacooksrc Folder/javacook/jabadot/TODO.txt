JabaDOT - Still lots to do!

Consistent start of JSP pages:
	<%@ import...
	$Id: TODO.txt,v 1.20 2002/05/18 20:42:42 ian Exp $
	Get session.
	<html, body, with appropriate style tag, from session->user->skins>

Rationalize jabadot.email.receive in initparams vs jabadot.mail.xxx in session

Write edit1.jsp. Display using same form as submit.jsp, but with
	Accept/Reject buttons instead of submit (reuse by include).

MyJabaDot
	- make it use same form as newuser.jsp, so you can change ANY field
	- require password for any changes.

Finish CSS for "skins"

JDConstants - needs serious rethinking: do we need such a class!?
		have "header.html" jsp:include servlet/JDConstants
		which won't do any output, but will check for p==null
		and, if so, ctx.getAttr("jabadot.dir"), then reloadProps()

Data Modelling:
	Database table for stories. State=submitted, approved, removed.
	Submit Story: save to DBMS in finished format, instead of text file.

Then Revise Search to search on subject, date, etc., using Lucene

News:
	import RSS - Meerkat?
	Export RSS - RSS servlet using ForCurrentNews jsp tag? J+X p 400


Change "User" to an EJB, with create(), create(...), findByName,
	set methods, and findAllUsers().

Missing Functionality
	Submit Bug Report
	Edit operation JSP to move from q to articles
	
View:
	More JSP Tag Library to reduce Java clutter in HTML

Go through and put encodeURL() around all generate URLs, for those
	who really & truly can't stand cookies (they prefer bread?).
