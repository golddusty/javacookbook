<h1>filterGUI</h1
<p.
This is meant to provide a framework for
Java programs that want to provide
chaining of various filters, or any other
example where you want to move items between
an inactive list and an active list.
It does some neat things, including balancing
the widths of the two JLists.
</p>
<p>The test classes are called Filters because this type of selection GUI
is often used to select chained filters, but the FilterGUI is much
more general than this: a list of files to include/exclude, a list of
users, or a list of filters; any of these can be used.
