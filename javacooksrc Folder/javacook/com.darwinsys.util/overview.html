	<title>Ian Darwin's Java Cookbook Utilities</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Utility classes from Ian Darwin's <i>Java Cookbook</i> (O'Reilly, 2001).
These classes implement many useful operations that one would normally
have to re-implement many times over.
</p>
<p>
Most of these are in the first edition of the book, but some
have had additions since then, and DataIO is new.
@see the <a href="http://javacook.darwinsys.com/">Author's Book Site</a> and
the <a href="http://java.oreilly.com/catalog/javacook/">O'Reilly Site</a>
for more information on this book.
