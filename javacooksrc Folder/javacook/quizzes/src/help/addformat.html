<P>This file is not written yet. Check out the file LoadSaveHTML.java
for a starting point.
LoadSaveHTML has a trivial load() method that just throws an exception,
as there is no point trying to reload the information from an HTML file.
Its save() method does the work not only of generating some heavy HTML,
but also randomizing the answers (using Random.nextInt() and JDK 1.2
Collections.sort() if available). At that, it is just over 100 lines of
Java code.
<P>The original LoadSave module, from which LoadSaveHTML is subclassed,
handles both loading and saving native-format files.
It is about 120 lines of Java.
