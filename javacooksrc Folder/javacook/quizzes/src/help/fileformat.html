<H1>The TestEdit File Format</H1>
<P>The basic file format is lines of plain Unicode (or ASCII) text.
Most lines begin with a command which is a single capital letter 
followed by a Unicode space character.
Null lines are silently ignored.
Lines beginning with the comments character "#" are allowed on input
<EM>but will be lost</EM> when the file is saved.
<H2>File Header</H2>
<P> Every file must begin with an X line.
The arguments are the course number, the exam (A, B, or C)
and the version number.
The second line must be a T line, with the course title.
The third line must be an N line, with the maximum number of questions
for the course. Here is an example of the first three lines:
<PRE>
X 471 A D.1
T Java for Programmers Hands-On
N 40
</PRE>
<H2>Question</H2>
Each question has a Q line for the question text (which must be first).
The first field is a question number, which is ignored - it is there
for reference, but is not required to be in order (you can set them all to
zero if you're generating the file from another program, for example).
There is also an O line stating the chapter objective,
an R line listing the correct answer, and up to four possible
answers, A, B, C, and D. 
These lines do not have to be in order.
There is customarily a blank line after the last one, but this is
for readability and is optional.
Here is a sample question:
<PRE>
Q 1 What does it all mean?
O 1
R C
A 20?
B 30?
C 42?
D 100?

</PRE><P>And another:<PRE>
Q 3 Given the code\
int i = 0;\
What is the value of i?
A 0
B 1
C 2
D 3
R A
O 2
</PRE>
